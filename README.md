Welcome to melo.ai - what I decided to call this project :)

To use the AI model to find new music to listen to, you can simply clone this repo, and run the prototype file. This model works based on the audio features extracted from the Spotify API.

This project also comes with a 250k song dataset (again from the Spotify API) that was engineered specifically for this project. Hope you enjoy it!

Feel free to message me if you have any questions.
